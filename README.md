Author: [Dennis Van Tonder](https://github.com/dennisvantonder/)
## Subject: IT Developments
The IT-environment changes at a fast pace. That is why we have a module with content regularly updated to keep up with newer developments in the IT-environment. The module is presented at the end of the degree to allow students to integrate their knowledge from other modules into this module. In the module, a series of projects are undertaken. Self-study and teamwork are important parts of these projects. These projects' goal is to expose the student to new IT challenges and appropriate technology to address these challenges. The development of soft skills is also part of the primary goal of this module.
## University project:

## Overview:
This repository contains a Power BI report that is used to monitor IoT devices. The report gives a quick overview of how many devices have been added over time, what category that device belongs, in what zone the device is in and more. The report consists of 4 pages: High-level metrics, Device monitoring, Device registration and the filter page.
## How to use report:

### How to filter report:
Elements on the pages are interactive and you can hover over items to view more information or click on items to filter the page.
Filters can also be applied over the whole report, if you navigate to the filter page, you can select on the slicers to filter the report based on your selection. Every visual on the report will then change according to your selection.
- Example:
You can change the slider to only view devices that was installed between a specific time frame. The report will then be filtered to only show devices that was installed between those dates.
